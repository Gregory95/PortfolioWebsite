                    <p>In 2013 i graduated from high school and went to University of Nicosia. In university i had the opportunity to see how a software works. How you can give commands by typing some lines of code. I got this feeling that every creator gets when it comes to imagination and make the ideas happen in real life.

                                My first professional job opportunity came in 4 of March 2019. I got an opportunity to work in Alpha Bank Cyprus as business analyst. I joined in an amazing team that works on projects that will create a new digital experience for Bank`s customers.
                                I was working on an extremely advanced project. PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2) is the second Payment Services Directive, designed by the countries of the European Union. It could revolutionize the payments industry, affecting everything from the way we pay online, to what information we see when making a payment.
                                Based on my passion on software development i was responsible to guide the programmers to create the best API products that Alpha Bank Cyprus will provide to the Third Party Provides (TPP).
